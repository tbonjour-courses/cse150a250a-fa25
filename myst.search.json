Keep in mind that ChatGPT is infamous for being very confidently wrong, so be critical of its output. Adapt anything you use and make sure you can explain it yourself.  Also keep in mind that you won‚Äôt have ChatGPT on the tests, so you‚Äôll need to understand the fundamental concepts for yourself in order to do well.\n\nIf you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Piazza.\n\nRegrade Requests\n\nRegrades for homework assignments must be requested through Gradescope within three days of the homework assignment being graded and returned to you.

If you believe your answer is correct and there was an error in grading, please explain that clearly. A valid regrade request must demonstrate that you have reviewed the feedback carefully and provide a clear explanation for the regrade. Requests that do not follow these guidelines will not be considered.\n\nA regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may lead to the score being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading.

The TTC‚Äôs rules concerning testing are the rules for this course.\n\nYou must schedule your tests in advance, and it is recommended that you do so as soon as possible. Scheduling for all tests opens on the first day of instruction.\n\nTo make sure you have access to the test questions, you need to be enrolled in PrairieLearn course instance. Both sections, CSE 150A and CSE 250A use the \n\nEnrollment Link.\n\nTo schedule the test, first make sure you self-enroll in the correct section below.\n\nIf you are enrolled in CSE 150A, please use \n\nCSE 150A Link\n\nIf you are enrolled in CSE 250A, please use \n\nCSE 250A Link\n\nOnce you have self-enrolled in your section, follow the \n\nRegistration Instructions at TTC-AP&M.\n\nMore information about testing policies and procedures can be found on the \n\nTTC‚Äôs website. You may also email \n\ntritontesting@ucsd‚Äã.edu for assistance.\n\nSTUDENTS WITH OSD APPROVED ACCOMMODATIONS: If you will be utilizing accommodations for your test, you will take it at the TTC‚Äôs Pepper Canyon Hall location. You must schedule your test at least three days in advance through the \n\nRegisterBlast system. RegisterBlast scheduling is to be done ONLY by students with OSD-approved accommodations. Tests scheduled via RegisterBlast without accommodations will be cancelled.\n\nMake-up Test\n\nIf needed, you may schedule a make-up test in Week 10. The make-up test is cumulative and covers all material through Week 9. If your make-up test score is higher than the lower of Test 1 or Test 2, it will replace that lower score. Taking the make-up test is optional.\n\nUnder this policy, a poor performance on an earlier test can be erased by stronger performance on the make-up test. If you score lower on the make-up test, it will not reduce your grade.\n\nExample: If you scored 60% on Test 1 and 90% on Test 2, and then earn 85% on the make-up test, your Test 1 score is replaced with 85%.","type":"content","url":"/syllabus#tests","position":49},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Syllabus","lvl2":"Grading"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/syllabus#grading","position":50},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Syllabus","lvl2":"Grading"},"content":"We will use the following grade breakdown:\n\nAssesment\n\nPercentage\n\nHomework\n\n40%\n\nTest 1\n\n15%\n\nTest 2\n\n15%\n\nMini-Project\n\n10%\n\nFinal Project\n\n15%\n\nParticipation\n\n5%\n\nGrading Scale\n\nIn a typical quarter, the make-up test serves the same role as a traditional grade curve, so no additional curve is applied. The standard grading scale above is the starting point, but after all scores are in a clustering algorithm will set the final cutoffs for each letter grade in each section (150A or 250A). These cutoffs can only move down, never up.

Instead, they are awarded to the top 5% of students in each section based on overall course grade.\n\nCalculating your grade: When calculating your homework grades, you should weigh each assignment by the points possible on that assignment. In other words, some homeworks are worth more, and some are worth less. This is by design, since some assignments are intentionally shorter.\n\nComprehensive Exam for MS Students: We will follow the department requirement of a B- or higher for the comprehensive exam and S/U grades. ‚ÄúPass‚Äù is any grade 80% or higher. \n\nPass/Not Pass for Undergraduate Students: We will follow the university grading system of C- or higher for P/NP grades. ‚ÄúPass‚Äù is any grade 70% or higher. \n\nIncomplete Grade: Sometimes, circumstances beyond a student‚Äôs control prevent them from completing a class even once they have completed the majority of the coursework at a passing level.

These cutoffs can only be lowered‚Äînever raised‚Äîso the A threshold will never exceed 94%.\n\nCan I take the tests remotely or schedule my test in another week?\n\nTests are in person at the Triton Testing Center. The self-scheduled tests already provide flexibility. Anything beyond this would require significant extra work for staff and is not allowed. Instead, the optional make-up test in Week 10 serves as a built-in backup: if you miss or underperform on an earlier test, the make-up can replace your lower score.\n\nWhat if I‚Äôm mildly sick and can‚Äôt submit homework on time?\n\nMinor illnesses are common. The 24-hour late window, optional make-up test, and participation drop are designed to absorb routine disruptions without individual exceptions. For serious illness or an extended medical issue, contact the instructor and provide documentation so we can coordinate accommodations.\n\nI‚Äôm close to the next grade up. Can you round my final grade or give extra credit work?\n\nNo. Grades are determined by the published policies for everyone. Offering extra work or rounding for individuals would be unfair and would create grading overload for the staff.\nWe also can‚Äôt offer special opportunities (such as extra work) to raise an individual grade. To be fair, any extra assignment would need to be offered to everyone, and even a percentage of takers would create more grading than the staff can handle at the end of the quarter. Instead, second chances are built into the course through the make-up test and other policies, which give all students the same opportunity to demonstrate mastery.","type":"content","url":"/syllabus#faqs","position":79}]}
