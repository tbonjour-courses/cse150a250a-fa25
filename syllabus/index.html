Please be sure to follow the collaboration policy outlined in the syllabus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attend office hours:</strong> Office hours are a great way to get help with course content, ask questions, and connect with the course staff. We have amazing TAs who are eager to help!</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on learning over grades:</strong> Grades may feel important now, but lasting value is in learning how to think through these problems yourself. Outsourcing the work to a friend, to the internet, or to an AI might get you a grade, but it cheats you out of the skills this course is designed to teach.</p></li></ul><p>CSE 150A / 250A is a rigorous but rewarding course.

Keep in mind that ChatGPT is infamous for being very confidently wrong, so be critical of its output. Adapt anything you use and make sure you can explain it yourself.  Also keep in mind that you won’t have ChatGPT on the tests, so you’ll need to understand the fundamental concepts for yourself in order to do well.</p><p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Piazza.</p><p><strong>Regrade Requests</strong></p><p>Regrades for homework assignments must be requested through <strong>Gradescope</strong> within <strong>three days</strong> of the homework assignment being graded and returned to you. Please do not request regrade for homework on Piazza or through email.</p><p>If you submit a regrade request, please include a brief but detailed explanation of why you think there was an error in the grading. If you believe your answer is correct and there was an error in grading, please explain that clearly. A valid regrade request must demonstrate that you have reviewed the feedback carefully and provide a clear explanation for the regrade. Requests that do not follow these guidelines will not be considered.</p><p>A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may lead to the score being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading.

Grace periods and make-up options (such as the 24-hour late window and the optional make-up test) are there so that an occasional conflict or busy week does not derail your progress.</p></li><li><p>Keep the course manageable. With hundreds of students, consistent rules and firm deadlines allow us to grade promptly and provide the level of support you expect.</p></li></ul><p>These policies are designed to handle most of the everyday disruptions of a quarter so you do not need to request one-off exceptions for routine issues.</p><p><strong>When to reach out</strong>
Some situations go beyond these built-in allowances. Please contact the instructor as soon as possible if you experience a serious illness, hospitalization, family emergency, accident, or other significant event that prevents you from meeting course requirements.

We start with the standard grading scale (A ≥ 94%, A- ≥ 90%, etc.). After all scores are in, we run a clustering algorithm to find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered—never raised—so the A threshold will never exceed 94%.</p><p><strong>Can I take the tests remotely or schedule my test in another week?</strong></p><p>Tests are in person at the Triton Testing Center. The self-scheduled tests already provide flexibility. Anything beyond this would require significant extra work for staff and is not allowed. Instead, the optional make-up test in Week 10 serves as a built-in backup: if you miss or underperform on an earlier test, the make-up can replace your lower score.</p><p><strong>What if I’m mildly sick and can’t submit homework on time?</strong></p><p>Minor illnesses are common. The 24-hour late window, optional make-up test, and participation drop are designed to absorb routine disruptions without individual exceptions. For serious illness or an extended medical issue, contact the instructor and provide documentation so we can coordinate accommodations.</p><p><strong>I’m close to the next grade up. Can you round my final grade or give extra credit work?</strong></p><p>No. Grades are determined by the published policies for everyone. Offering extra work or rounding for individuals would be unfair and would create grading overload for the staff.
We also can’t offer special opportunities (such as extra work) to raise an individual grade. To be fair, any extra assignment would need to be offered to everyone, and even a percentage of takers would create more grading than the staff can handle at the end of the quarter. Instead, second chances are built into the course through the make-up test and other policies, which give all students the same opportunity to demonstrate mastery.</p><div></div><div class="flex pt-10
