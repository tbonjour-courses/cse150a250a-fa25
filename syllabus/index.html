Discuss problems together and compare approaches, but each student (or project group) must submit work that reflects their own understanding. Talking through ideas is a great way to learn, but writing your own solutions leads to deeper understanding than simply sharing files.</p><p>You may also use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) in the same spirit: ask questions, get hints, or debug, but don’t copy AI output verbatim. Keep in mind that ChatGPT is infamous for being very confidently wrong, so be critical of its output. Adapt anything you use and make sure you can explain it yourself.  Also keep in mind that you won’t have ChatGPT on the tests, so you’ll need to understand the fundamental concepts for yourself in order to do well.</p><p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Piazza.</p><p><strong>Regrade Requests</strong></p><p>Regrades for homework assignments must be requested through <strong>Gradescope</strong> within <strong>three days</strong> of the homework assignment being graded and returned to you. Please do not request regrade for homework on Piazza or through email.</p><p>If you submit a regrade request, please include a brief but detailed explanation of why you think there was an error in the grading. If you believe your answer is correct and there was an error in grading, please explain that clearly. A valid regrade request must demonstrate that you have reviewed the feedback carefully and provide a clear explanation for the regrade. Requests that do not follow these guidelines will not be considered.</p><p>A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may lead to the score being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading.

RegisterBlast scheduling is to be done <strong>ONLY by students with OSD-approved accommodations. Tests scheduled via RegisterBlast without accommodations will be cancelled.</strong></p><p><strong>Make-up Test</strong></p><p>If needed, you may schedule a make-up test in <strong>Week 10</strong>. The make-up test is cumulative and covers all material through Week 9. If your make-up test score is higher than the lower of Test 1 or Test 2, it will replace that lower score. Taking the make-up test is <strong>optional</strong>.</p><p>Under this policy, a poor performance on an earlier test can be erased by stronger performance on the make-up test. If you score lower on the make-up test, it will not reduce your grade.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you scored 60% on Test 1 and 90% on Test 2, and then earn 85% on the make-up test, your Test 1 score is replaced with 85%.</p><h2 id="grading" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Grading</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#grading" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>We will use the following grade breakdown:</p><table class=""><tbody><tr class=""><th class="">Assesment</th><th class="">Percentage</th></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Homework</td><td class="">40%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Test 1</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Test 2</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Mini-Project</td><td class="">10%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Final Project</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Participation</td><td class="">5%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Grading Scale</strong></p><p>In a typical quarter, the make-up test serves the same role as a traditional grade curve, so no additional curve is applied.

Instead, they are awarded to the top 5% of students in each section based on overall course grade.</p><p><strong>Calculating your grade:</strong> When calculating your homework grades, you should weigh each assignment by the points possible on that assignment. In other words, some homeworks are worth more, and some are worth less. This is by design, since some assignments are intentionally shorter.</p><p><strong>Comprehensive Exam for MS Students:</strong> We will follow the department requirement of a <strong>B-</strong> or higher for the comprehensive exam and S/U grades.</p><p><strong>Pass/Not Pass for Undergraduate Students:</strong> We will follow the university grading system of <strong>C-</strong> or higher for P/NP grades.</p><p><strong>Incomplete Grade:</strong> Sometimes, circumstances beyond a student’s control prevent them from completing a class even once they have completed the majority of the coursework at a passing level.

Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive.</p><p>Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course. If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input.</p><p>We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html" class="">https://<wbr/>ucsd<wbr/>.edu<wbr/>/about<wbr/>/principles<wbr/>.html</a>), along with the guidelines for online interaction posted on the site. Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences may be different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.</p><p>If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

We start with the standard grading scale (A ≥ 94%, A- ≥ 90%, etc.). After all scores are in, we run a clustering algorithm to find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered—never raised—so the A threshold will never exceed 94%.</p><p><strong>Can I take the tests remotely or schedule my test in another week?</strong></p><p>Tests are in person at the Triton Testing Center. The self-scheduled tests already provide flexibility. Anything beyond this would require significant extra work for staff and is not allowed. Instead, the optional make-up test in Week 10 serves as a built-in backup: if you miss or underperform on an earlier test, the make-up can replace your lower score.</p><p><strong>What if I’m mildly sick and can’t submit homework on time?</strong></p><p>Minor illnesses are common. The 24-hour late window, optional make-up test, and participation drop are designed to absorb routine disruptions without individual exceptions. For serious illness or an extended medical issue, contact the instructor and provide documentation so we can coordinate accommodations.</p><p><strong>I’m close to the next grade up. Can you round my final grade or give extra credit work?</strong></p><p>No. Grades are determined by the published policies for everyone. Offering extra work or rounding for individuals would be unfair and would create grading overload for the staff.
We also can’t offer special opportunities (such as extra work) to raise an individual grade. To be fair, any extra assignment would need to be offered to everyone, and even a percentage of takers would create more grading than the staff can handle at the end of the quarter. Instead, second chances are built into the course through the make-up test and other policies, which give all students the same opportunity to demonstrate mastery.</p><div></div><div class="flex pt-10 mb-10 space-x-4"><a class="flex-1 block p-4 font-normal text-gray-600 no-underline border border-gray-200 rounded shadow-sm group hover:border-blue-600 dark:hover:border-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-400 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500 hover:shadow-lg dark:shadow-neutral-700" href="/fa25/schedule"><div class="flex h-full align-middle"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="self-center transition-transform group-hover:-translate-x-1 shrink-0"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5 3 12m0 0 7.5-7.5M3 12h18"></path></svg><div class="flex-grow text-right"><div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">CSE 150A/250A</div>Schedule</div></div></a><a class="flex-1 block p-4 font-normal text-gray-600 no-underline border border-gray-200 rounded shadow-sm group hover:border-blue-600 dark:hover:border-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-400 dark:text-gray-100 dark:border-gray-500 hover:shadow-lg dark:shadow-neutral-700" href="/fa25/office-hours"><div class="flex h-full align-middle"><div class="flex-grow"><div class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">CSE 150A/250A</div>Office Hours</div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="self-center transition-transform group-hover:translate-x-1 shrink-0"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M13.5 4.5 21 12m0 0-7.5 7.5M21 12H3"></path></svg></div></a></div></main></article><script>((a,d)=>{if(!window.history.state||!window.history.state.key){let h=Math.random().toString(32).slice(2);window.history.replaceState({key:h},"")}try{let f=JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(a)||"{}")[d||window.history.state.key];typeof f=="number"&&window.scrollTo(0,f)}catch(h){console.error(h),sessionStorage.removeItem(a)}})("positions", null)</script><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/entry.client-UNPC4GT3.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-OCTKKCIL.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-UAI5KRM7.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-2NH4LW52.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-JSE36H2O.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-HBJK6BW3.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-HYMQ7M2K.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-OHOXABTA.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-OCWQY3HK.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-C7FW3E47.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-3CVK3PYF.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-J6FHCSRC.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-ND43KHSX.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-GUCIBHGO.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/root-IB5726YR.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/_shared/chunk-NBON2RSI.js"/><link rel="modulepreload" href="/fa25/build/routes/$-LXLHKVOR.js"/><script>window.__remixContext = {"url":"/syllabus","state":{"loaderData":{"root":{"config":{"version":2,"myst":"1.6.1","options":{"outline_maxdepth":1,"favicon":"/fa25/build/favicon-35557d01e765eddf606d3f52bf7e6494.ico","logo":"/fa25/build/site_logo-c8c747692d9af50df7b49bebd3e1ceb9.svg","logo_text":"CSE 150A/250A (Fall 2025)","style":"/fa25/build/custom-5e9510b1bcbcff0e4f283732800c6497.css"},"nav":[],"actions":[],"projects":[{"title":"CSE 150A/250A","description":"AI -
