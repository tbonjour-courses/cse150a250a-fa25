Keep in mind that ChatGPT is infamous for being very confidently wrong, so be critical of its output. Adapt anything you use and make sure you can explain it yourself.  Also keep in mind that you won’t have ChatGPT on the tests, so you’ll need to understand the fundamental concepts for yourself in order to do well.</p><p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Piazza.</p><p><strong>Regrade Requests</strong></p><p>Regrades for homework assignments must be requested through <strong>Gradescope</strong> within <strong>three days</strong> of the homework assignment being graded and returned to you.

A valid regrade request must demonstrate that you have reviewed the feedback carefully and provide a clear explanation for the regrade. Requests that do not follow these guidelines will not be considered.</p><p>A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may lead to the score being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading.

Taking the make-up test is <strong>optional</strong>.</p><p>Under this policy, a poor performance on an earlier test can be erased by stronger performance on the make-up test. If you score lower on the make-up test, it will not reduce your grade.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you scored 60% on Test 1 and 90% on Test 2, and then earn 85% on the make-up test, your Test 1 score is replaced with 85%.</p><h2 id="grading" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Grading</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#grading" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>We will use the following grade breakdown:</p><table class=""><tbody><tr class=""><th class="">Assesment</th><th class="">Percentage</th></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Homework</td><td class="">40%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Test 1</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Test 2</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Mini-Project</td><td class="">10%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Final Project</td><td class="">15%</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Participation</td><td class="">5%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Grading Scale</strong></p><p>In a typical quarter, the make-up test serves the same role as a traditional grade curve, so no additional curve is applied.

We start with the standard grading scale (A ≥ 94%, A- ≥ 90%, etc.). After all scores are in, we run a clustering algorithm to find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered—never raised—so the A threshold will never exceed 94%.</p><p><strong>Can I take the tests remotely or schedule my test in another week?</strong></p><p>Tests are in person at the Triton Testing Center. The self-scheduled tests already provide flexibility. Anything beyond this would require significant extra work for staff and is not allowed. Instead, the optional make-up test in Week 10 serves as a built-in backup: if you miss or underperform on an earlier test, the make-up can replace your lower score.</p><p><strong>What if I’m mildly sick and can’t submit homework on time?</strong></p><p>Minor illnesses are common. The 24-hour late window, optional make-up test, and participation drop are designed to absorb routine disruptions without individual exceptions. For serious illness or an extended medical issue, contact the instructor and provide documentation so we can coordinate accommodations.</p><p><strong>I’m close to the next grade up. Can you round my final grade or give extra credit work?</strong></p><p>No. Grades are determined by the published policies for everyone. Offering extra work or rounding for individuals would be unfair and would create grading overload for the staff.
We also can’t offer special opportunities (such as extra work) to raise an individual grade. To be fair, any extra assignment would need to be offered to everyone, and even a percentage of takers would create more grading than the staff can handle at the end of the quarter. Instead, second chances are built into the course through the make-up test and other policies, which give all students the same opportunity to demonstrate mastery.</p><div></div><div class="flex pt-10
